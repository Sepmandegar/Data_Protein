In this work, we have performed an alternative analytical process including the transformation of few biological molecules’ frequencies data obtained by 13CNMR spectroscopy into sounds characterized with their frequencies, intensities, and time durations. As a main point, we have relied on the “magnetic behavior of proton” as a positively charged species in the nucleus to measure the nucleus relaxation time and frequency domains. This proposal is examined for human beta-globin sequences using only “α-carbon” of their containing amino acids. Similarly, “all 23 kinds of carbon atoms in the Leu- and Met-enkephalins” as hormones have been studied and converted to musical data using time–frequency MUSIC algorithm (TFMusic-A) in which Max/MSP program is used for musical conversions. The results show that the TFMusic-A might be a proper candidate and primarily a creative symbolic method for fundamental unity between the natural ordered structure of life and humans.
